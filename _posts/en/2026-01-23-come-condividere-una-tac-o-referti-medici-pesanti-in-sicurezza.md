**Do you need to send a CT scan or MRI, but the file is too large? Discover how Dante shared his large medical reports securely with Ippocra.**

## How to share a CT Scan?
Have you ever tried to email the results of a CT scan or MRI, only to receive an error message saying "the file is too large"?

Modern diagnostic imaging exams produce very high-resolution files, often in DICOM format, that can exceed 100 MB. Because of this, many patients mistakenly use generic file-transfer services or, worse, hinder progress by physically shipping CDs and USB drives via courier, significantly delaying the diagnostic process. [Sharing medical reports between different facilities]({% post_url en/2026-01-14-come-condividere-referti-medici-tra-strutture-diverse %}){:target="_blank"} remains a challenge for many patients.

This was exactly the problem that Dante, one of our users, faced when he urgently needed to get a second opinion from a specialist hundreds of kilometers away:

*Dante's question received via WhatsApp and translated from German:*
> Good evening, I am an Ippocra customer with an urgent issue. My neurologist requested that the CT scan I took last week be sent to him before my appointment tomorrow. Can I use Ippocra to send it, as I do with PDF medical reports?
>
> Good evening, Dante, indeed! Ippocra also handles diagnostic imaging files, such as CT scans and MRIs. We created a video on our YouTube channel to explain how to do it.
> If you need assistance, we're here. Good luck!

## The Risk of Traditional Methods: Why "Working" Isn't Enough

When it comes to radiological imaging, simplicity must never compromise security:

* **Email and attachment limits:** most servers block files over 25 MB. Splitting a CT scan across multiple emails makes it impossible for the doctor to review.
* **Free file-sharing services:** downloading medical reports to non-healthcare platforms exposes your sensitive data to data breach risks. Often, such services are not compliant with GDPR for the processing of health data.
* **Physical media (CD/DVD):** beyond the slowness of shipping, many doctors today use laptops without optical drives, making physical media completely useless during the appointment.

## Professional Management of High-Resolution Medical Reports

Dante used Ippocra to overcome the technical limitations of traditional sending, while maintaining complete control over his medical history.

### 1. Cloud Storage Optimized for Large Volumes

Ippocra is designed to host large medical reports. By uploading your CT scan or MRI to the platform, the file is [protected by advanced encryption systems]({% post_url en/2025-12-28-how-to-safely-store-and-share-your-medical-records-online %}){:target="_blank"} and made available for immediate consultation, regardless of the device used.

### 2. Immediate Accessibility for the Specialist

The advantage of having your heavy exams on Ippocra is availability. You won't need to worry about carrying bulky radiographic folders: your entire imaging documentation is accessible with a click, allowing the doctor to view the necessary details in high definition.

### 3. Encrypted and Temporary Sharing Links

To allow the specialist to analyze the CT scan, Dante generated a [secure sharing link (IppoLink)]({% post_url en/2024-12-06-ippolink-launch %}){:target="_blank"}.

* **Security:** The doctor receives protected access without the file needing to "travel" through insecure channels.
* **Control:** Dante was able to set an expiration date for the link, ensuring that his medical reports were visible only for the time necessary for the consultation.

## Technology at the Service of Diagnostic Timeliness

In medicine, time is often a determining factor. Don't let a technical "file size" limitation become an obstacle to your health. Managing and sharing voluminous medical reports must be a smooth, fast, and, above all, compliant process with the highest security standards.

Do like Dante: make your radiological documentation agile and ready to be shared with the best specialists, wherever they are.

**The quality of your care also depends on how easily your doctors can consult your exams.**

### Professional FAQ on Sharing Heavy Files

**Can I upload files from the CD the hospital gave me?** Certainly. You can transfer digital files (usually in PDF format or high-resolution images) from physical media to your personal area on Ippocra so they're always available and ready to share.

**Is there a limit to the number of medical reports I can share at the same time?** Ippocra allows you to organize your medical history in a structured way. You can select multiple exams, even large ones, and share them via a single secure link, which facilitates the doctor's work and provides a comprehensive view of your clinical picture.

**Does the doctor need an Ippocra account to access my CT scan** No. The doctor will be able to view the medical reports you decide to share directly via the secure link you will send him, without the need for registration, ensuring maximum speed during the consultation phase.
