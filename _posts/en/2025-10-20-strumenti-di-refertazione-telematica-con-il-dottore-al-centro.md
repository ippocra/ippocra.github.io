# Simplify Your Work: The Document Editor Is Now Available!

Ippocra was created to connect Doctors with their Patients while also providing simple, fast tools that enable the best results in the shortest time possible. Since we [launched our platform to the public]({% post_url en/2025-03-07-open-for-business %}){:target="_blank"}, we've focused on building tools that healthcare professionals need.

With this idea in mind we built our Document Editor, which lets a Doctor write a report focused on the diagnosis, preview it, and then save and send it directly to the patient in a digitally secure way using our [Ippolinks]({% post_url en/2024-12-06-ippolink-launch %}){:target="_blank"}.

# Writing a Report Has Never Been This Easy

Select the patient for whom you want to write the report, click **Write Report**, and simply type the diagnosis using our editor.

You can view a preview of the document, or save it instantly and automatically send it to the patient.
