We just launched a new functionality and we have a new website!

## IppoLink is now online!

If you found yourself going to a new doctor, you know that the first question they will 
have is if you have old analysis or report that you can share to provide a view of your 
health situation. Usually the reponse to that was: **PANIC**.

Not anymore! Thanks to the *Secret-Link* functionality you can securely share the date with
your new specialist, either scannig the QR Code, or simply providing the link to the 
doctor. The ippolink will be active only for a short period of time, and then it will 
auto-destroy, preserving your documents.
