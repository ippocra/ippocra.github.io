*Medical Campus sends their reports via the Ippolinks: refreshing like a swim in the blue sea*


## Ippocra x Medical Campus

[Medical Campus](https://medicalcampus.it/) has chosen [Ippocra](https://ippocra.com) as the innovative 
solution to send their own reports. From today, the doctors working at Medical Campus will be able to 
send the reports via the Ippolink, without the need to prin them, and having a way to share them with 
the patient in a secure and rapid manner. When the patient receives the ippolink, they can either download it
or they can import it, after making an account, on Ippocra, starting the collection of their own medical data. 
They will be able to add more documents as they come.

_"We are very pleased to have been choosen by Medical Campus. We see this collaboration as the confirmation 
that Ippocra is proposing a solution that solves the problems of our users (business users, in this case), with 
a new and innovative way to manage the medical documents, with the focus on the security and without forgetting
the easy of use, always being GDPR compliant."_ -- Michele Mattioni, CEO Ippocra.

_"When Ippocra's team has proposed to use thier Platform, we have quickly choosen the opportunity to innovate how 
we provide our reports to our patients. It was clear from the beginning that it was an efficient solution, not only
to improve how we provide the reports, but also to have a digital archive always available, easy to search and protected
by the Ippocra security.

Our mission is the innovation: we have started with DentalCampus, becoming one of the leaders in Italy for the dental education, and now we carry on with MedicalCampus, a Polyclinic focused on medical and dental services. And now, thanks to
Ippocra, we will offer also to our patients a modern, safe, and easy way to receive and archive their own reports."_ -- Valentina Sanguigni, Amministratore Delegato di Dental e Medical Campus.
