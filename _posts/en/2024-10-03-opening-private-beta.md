We are very pleased to announce that we have opened our private beta.

From today is possible to register an account on to try and test it. Register here!

We also received the feedback from our first users, and we have provided the ability to change the document name after the upload, improved our capacity to detect the date in the documents uploaded and many more.

Thank you for your support!
