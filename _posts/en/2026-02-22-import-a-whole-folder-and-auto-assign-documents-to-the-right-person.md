**Uploading one file at a time is slow. Sorting everything manually is stressful. From today, you can import a whole folder and let Ippocra auto-assign each document to the right person.**

## A Common Problem in Family Health Management

Most families do not have one person and one document stream. They have parents, children, sometimes grandparents, and documents arriving from different clinics, labs, and specialists.

The result is always the same:

- many files in nested folders
- inconsistent file names from labs and hospitals
- manual sorting that takes too much time
- avoidable mistakes, especially when people have similar names

This is exactly why people ask us how to [choose the right tool to manage family medical records]({% post_url en/2026-01-26-come-scegliere-uno-strumento-per-gestire-i-referti-medici-della-famiglia %}){:target="_blank"}: the real issue is not just storage, but organization at scale.

## What Is New: Full Folder Import with Automatic Assignment

Ippocra now lets you import a complete folder in one action.

During import, the system analyzes:

- **folder path structure** (for example: `/Family/Laura/Cardiology/2026`)
- **document names** (for example: `Laura_Rossi_Blood_Test_2026-02-15.pdf`)

Using these signals, Ippocra automatically links each file to the person it most likely belongs to.

You can still review and adjust assignments before final confirmation, so you keep full control.

## How It Works in Practice

### 1. Upload the Folder, Not Single Files

Instead of selecting one document at a time, select the parent folder that already contains your medical records.

This works very well for people migrating from local archives, external drives, or cloud folders.

### 2. Ippocra Reads Path and Filename Context

Our import engine checks naming cues and folder hierarchy to infer ownership.

If your old archive is partially organized, the system can reuse that structure to accelerate assignment.

### 3. Confirm and Continue

After analysis, review the proposed person-to-document matches and confirm. In minutes, your records become searchable and structured.

From there, you can use features already available on the platform:

- [smart archive support for complex files such as ZIP uploads]({% post_url en/2025-03-27-archive-support %}){:target="_blank"}
- [secure sharing across clinics and specialists]({% post_url en/2026-01-14-come-condividere-referti-medici-tra-strutture-diverse %}){:target="_blank"}
- [privacy-focused storage and sharing best practices]({% post_url en/2025-12-28-how-to-safely-store-and-share-your-medical-records-online %}){:target="_blank"}

*Bulk import form folder and with auto person suggestions in operation*

## Why This Feature Matters

### Save Time During Setup

Bulk import removes the highest-friction step for new users: initial document migration.

### Reduce Manual Sorting Errors

Automatic assignment lowers the chance of placing a report in the wrong profile, especially in family accounts with high document volume.

### Build a Cleaner Long-Term Timeline

When documents start in the right profile, everything else gets easier:

- faster retrieval before appointments
- better continuity between providers
- clearer history when helping parents or children

If you have already experienced the stress of missing reports before a visit, this new workflow directly addresses that problem. It follows the same goal we discussed in our [real user story about finding documents quickly under pressure]({% post_url en/2026-01-02-user-story-non-trovavamo-un-referto-anche-dopo-avere-messo-la-sala-a-soqquadro %}){:target="_blank"}.

## Example: From Folder Chaos to Structured Records

Before:

- a local folder called `Medical Documents`
- subfolders by year, clinic, or exam type
- mixed names and duplicate copies

After using folder import:

- documents assigned to the right person automatically
- records visible in the correct profile
- less cleanup work and faster first-time setup

This is especially useful for caregivers managing documents for multiple family members, including elderly parents.

## A Better First Hour on Ippocra

The first hour in a health-record platform should not be spent renaming files. It should be spent building a reliable archive you can use when care decisions are time-sensitive.

With full folder import and automatic assignment, you can move from scattered files to an organized clinical history in one guided flow.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need perfectly named files for automatic assignment to work?**

No. Clear naming helps, but Ippocra also uses folder path context. Even partially organized archives can be processed effectively.

**Can I correct assignments before finalizing the import?**

Yes. Suggested matches are reviewable, and you can adjust them before confirming.

**Is this useful only for new users?**

No. Existing users can also use folder import when migrating old backups, clinic exports, or previously unmanaged archives.
