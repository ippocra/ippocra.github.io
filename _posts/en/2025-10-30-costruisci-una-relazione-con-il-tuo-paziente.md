**A solution that puts your brand front‑and‑center, fostering a lasting relationship with your client**

# Offer the Sponsored Plan to Your Client

From the very beginning when we [launched IppoLink]({% post_url en/2024-12-06-ippolink-launch %}){:target="_blank"}, Ippocra has allowed users to save documents received via Ippolink into their 
own personal plan, selecting the appropriate user profile. This capability remains available with our 
free _Ippo_ plan for everyone, as we outlined [when we opened for business]({% post_url en/2025-03-07-open-for-business %}){:target="_blank"}.

Starting today, Ippocra introduces a new opportunity: the **Sponsored Plan**, which can be activated 
by our business users for their clients. [Healthcare practices like Medical Campus]({% post_url en/2025-05-14-medical-campus-sceglie-ippocra %}){:target="_blank"} are already seeing the benefits of this approach.

When a new user receives an Ippolink from a business user who has an active Sponsored Plan, they are 
offered a free _Family_ plan. This plan lasts for **12 months** and grants access to all the features 
reserved for paid plans.

# Customer Retention

The Sponsored Plan stays active only if the client returns for a clinic visit (for example, a follow‑up 
appointment). Each visit automatically renews the plan, encouraging annual screenings and ensuring the 
clinic retains its client.
