**A solution that puts your brand front‑and‑center, fostering a lasting relationship with your client**

# Offer the Sponsored Plan to Your Client

From the very beginning, Ippocra has allowed users to save documents received via Ippolink into their 
own personal plan, selecting the appropriate user profile. This capability remains available with our 
free _Ippo_ plan for everyone.

Starting today, Ippocra introduces a new opportunity: the **Sponsored Plan**, which can be activated 
by our business users for their clients.

When a new user receives an Ippolink from a business user who has an active Sponsored Plan, they are 
offered a free _Family_ plan. This plan lasts for **12 months** and grants access to all the features 
reserved for paid plans.

# Customer Retention

The Sponsored Plan stays active only if the client returns for a clinic visit (for example, a follow‑up 
appointment). Each visit automatically renews the plan, encouraging annual screenings and ensuring the 
clinic retains its client.
