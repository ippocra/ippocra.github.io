We just launched a new functionality and we have a new website!

## Secret-Link is now online!

If you found yourself going to a new doctor, you know that the first question they will 
have is if you have old analysis or report that you can share to provide a view of your 
health situation. Usually the reponse to that was: **PANIC**.

Not anymore! Thanks to the *Secret-Link* functionality you can securely share the date with
your new specialist, either scannig the QR Code, or simply providing the link to the 
doctor. The secret-link will be active only for a short period of time, and then it will 
auto-destroy, preserving your documents.
