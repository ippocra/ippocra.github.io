*New PDF experience - easier to look at your reports, even from the seaside*

# A newly optimized PDFViewer, directly on the platform

At [Ippocra](https://ippocra.com) we have a constant communication with our users, and 
we are looking to improve our products to match our customers desires and needs.

That's why we are very happy to announce the availability of a newly customized and embedded PDF 
Viewer, which is mobile friendly and supports to pinch-to-zoom capability. What is that?
You can zoom with your fingers to enlarge the document directly with your fingers, as 
you are now accustomed to do it.

You may be curious to see how it looks like? 

Let me add three dots for the suspense!


`...` <-- **Creating the suspense**

*PDF displayed within the Ippocra platform*

More over, the *back button* brings you back to your documents list, 
maintaining your search, in case you have done one. Because the 
**Smart Search** let's you search what you need, when you need.

As usual, you may need to open the PDF externally, so you can simply do it
using the button at the bottom of the page. You decide which way works best
for you.
