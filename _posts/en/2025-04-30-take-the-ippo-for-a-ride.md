*Do you want to take a ride with Ippo on the Conero? :)*

## Strolling with Ippo

**Ippo** is our mascot. It is funny, it's green (eheh), but most importantly, starting from 
today, is possible to take it for a ride!

We have revamped our plans, and now, our free plan (Ippo), gives you the ability to upload documents,
so you can take Ippo for a ride, and understand how you medical documents can become an asset for you.

You can create a profile Person for you, and also for another Person, so you can start to upload the 
documents for both!

All the documents uploaded are automatically encrypted, and they are stored in EU Servers, in a GDPR 
compliant mode.

Once you uploaded a document, automatically we will extract the date of the exam, categorize it, and 
also activate the smart search, which provides you the possibility to search also the content of 
the document.

You can take a picture directly with your phone, and upload it to Ippocra, and Ippo will take care 
of the rest. We built Ippocra to be mobile first, given that you will need this info on the go, most 
of the time.

As you know, **we do not sell or share any document with anyone**. How can we do that? Because of our 
paid plans. **Remember: if you do not pay for the product, you are the product**. If you want 
to use Ippocra, after the five initial docs to understand how it works, you have to choose 
[one of our paid plans](https:ippocra.com/en/pricing).

At Ippocra we believe that personal data must stay secure, and private. They are yours.

*Trivia*: did you know that if you upload a report on WhatsApp, now the content gets extracted and 
could be used to train the Meta AI? Personally speaking, I'm not up for that.

Instead, with Ippocra, you can provide your medical data in a secure way via the Ippolink,
which can be sent to the medical personal (or whoever **you** have decided to send it to.), and 
it will expire automatically, avoiding spreading your information around.

**You can share the ippolink via WhatsApp**, because that's secure and they cannot 
extract the information from there.

*Say hello to Ippo: ready to take a stroll, or to go on adventure with you!*

# The more the merrier

We have upgraded the *Just Me* plan. It's now called **Just Us**! You can now have 
up to 2 Admins and up to 2 person profile in the plan.

Are you ready to take the Ippo for a stroll?
