![image-center](/assets/images/forte-altavilla-luna.jpg){: .align-center}**Ippocra Business now with Analytics – the telescope to better see the moon!**  

Our business clients asked us to understand how their patients interact with Ippocra. The most common questions were:  

- *Do they receive and open the Ippolinks we send?*  
- *Do they view the reports that are sent?*  

These pieces of information, among others, are essential because they show how Ippocra is actually used and whether users find it useful.  

Internally we have a **data‑room** where we monitor these behaviors. Until recently we provided dedicated reports for each business client, but those did not allow real‑time data access nor offered an overall view of the situation.

## Analytics on Ippocra Business  

We are pleased to introduce our new analytics tools.

Thanks to the analytics you can, at a glance:  

- see how many people are active in your plan;  
- know the number of documents uploaded to Ippocra;  
- check how many times those documents have been viewed.  

You can also observe the trend of clicks on **Ippolinks** and document views.  

Analytics are already available on all the Business plans.
