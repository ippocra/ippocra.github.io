**No need to overturn the living room to find a report when you use Ippocra**

## The context: a house in chaos

Our user had scheduled a medical appointment for one of his children on Thursday morning. On Wednesday evening, the family began a **desperate hunt** throughout the house:

- **Drawers opened** and re‑checked multiple times.  
- **Cabinets and shelves** inspected down to the last shelf.  
- The **dedicated health‑documents folder**, but without the needed file.

Despite the effort, the **requested report** never appeared. Disappointment grew: the appointment was the next day and the doctor would need the document for the visit. The clock already read **22:47**, patience had run out, and this wasn’t the first time.

## Ippocra’s intervention

Tired of this search, the user decided to **try <a href="{{site.url}}">Ippocra</a>**. Here’s what happened:

1. **Rapid upload** – He started uploading all available documents (PDFs, photos, scans) directly onto the platform.  
2. **Automatic indexing** – Ippocra extracted the date, exam type, and textual content, categorizing them into groups (analysis, reports, receipts).  
3. **Smart search** – With a simple keyword (“ultrasound report 12/03/2024”) the document appeared **in less than a second**.  
4. **Sharing with the doctor** – One click generated a secure, encrypted link ready to be sent to the physician.

Thanks to these steps, the user was able to **send the report to the doctor before the appointment**, avoiding further delays and stress.
