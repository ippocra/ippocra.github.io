**Creating an account should take seconds, not forms and password rules. Ippocra now supports Magic Link signup so new users can register and start organizing medical records immediately.**

## New: Passwordless Signup With Magic Link

The new signup flow lets you create your Ippocra account through email verification, without setting a password during registration.

This reduces drop-off and helps users complete onboarding when they are already busy with healthcare tasks.

## Why Traditional Signup Fails

Classic registration flows often include multiple high-friction steps:

- password complexity rules
- confirmation fields and validation errors
- forgotten credentials immediately after signup
- repeated retries on mobile keyboards

For a healthcare product, this friction is costly: users delay setup and postpone uploading critical documents.

## How Magic Link Signup Works

1. Enter your email on the registration page.
2. Receive a secure Magic Link.
3. Click to verify and activate your account instantly.
4. Start uploading and organizing records right away.

No password setup, no reset emails on day one.

## Benefits for Patients, Families and Caregivers

### Faster time to value

Users can move directly from signup to practical actions: uploading reports, finding exams, and sharing documents.

### Better onboarding completion rate

Reducing signup friction means more users complete activation successfully.

### Cleaner security posture

Passwordless onboarding avoids weak or reused passwords from the start.

### Stronger continuity of care

When registration is easier, families are more likely to centralize records early and keep them updated.

## Designed for Real-World Healthcare Workflows

People register on Ippocra in practical situations: after an exam, before a visit, or while helping relatives remotely. The new Magic Link signup flow is designed for those moments.

Less setup friction means faster adoption, better archive completeness and fewer onboarding interruptions.
