## New data type unlocked: the .zip

Talking to our users, we have understood the need to support a new data type, 
which would be extremely handy to have on [Ippocra](http://ippocra.com): the archive 
in `.zip` format.

For example, some CT-scans or TACs, are usually provided in archived zip format, 
and our users would like to archive these data, always using our encrypted and secure 
technology, as all the other medical data; and finally, they would like to share these
via our [ippolinks](https://ippocra.com/en/news/2025/03/07/open-for-business.html#ippolink-share-your-health-data-securely-and-quickly).


Today we are presenting this new feature:

*We made space for the zip-file*

So, on top of PDFs and pictures maybe taken from the mobile, today also `.zip` files can be uploaded.

Ciao for now!
