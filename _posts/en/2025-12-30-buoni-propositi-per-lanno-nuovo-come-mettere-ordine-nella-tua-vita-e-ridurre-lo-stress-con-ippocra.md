**Less stress next year: Organize your medical documents with Ippocra**


## Introduction

The new year is the perfect time to set **good resolutions for the new year**. Many of us want to improve our routines, organize our commitments, and, most importantly, **lower the level of stress** associated with searching for important information. One often‑overlooked area is the management of medical reports: scattered documents, incomprehensible folders, and forgotten deadlines can increase daily anxiety. With [**Ippocra**](https://ippocra.com){:target="_blank"}, however, you can **bring order to our lives** and have all your reports just a click away, once and for all—a goal we've [been working toward since opening our platform]({% post_url en/2025-03-07-open-for-business %}){:target="_blank"}.

## 1. Define your good resolutions clearly

| Good resolution | How to measure it | Recommended tool |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Organize appointments** | Number of events entered into the weekly calendar | Google Calendar or reminder apps |
| **Reduce "search‑and‑find" stress** | Average time spent looking for documents (minutes/day) | [Ippocra – digital archive of reports]({% post_url en/2025-12-28-how-to-safely-store-and-share-your-medical-records-online %}){:target="_blank"} |
| **Improve mental wellbeing** | Frequency of mindfulness practices (times/week) | Meditation |

Write your resolutions using the **SMART** framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time‑bound) to make them concrete and easier to achieve.

## 2. Bring order to our lives: the role of digital organization

### Why organization matters
1. **Less wasted time** – When everything is catalogued, you find what you need instantly.  
2. **Better focus** – A tidy workspace reduces distractions.  
3. **Deadline control** – Automatic reminders prevent missed payments or medical visits.

### How to start
1. **Gather all paper documents** (bills, prescriptions, reports).  
2. **Scan or photograph** the documents with your smartphone—[exactly as we designed the platform to work]({% post_url en/2025-05-07-take-the-ippo-for-a-ride %}){:target="_blank"}.  
3. **Upload the files to Ippocra** using the secure upload feature.  

> **Tip:** Use descriptive tags (e.g., "Cardiology visit – 2024") to make searching even faster. Our [intelligent search capabilities]({% post_url en/2024-10-03-opening-private-beta %}){:target="_blank"} will help you find what you need instantly.

## 3. Lower our stress level when looking for things

“Search‑and‑find” stress is often caused by:
- **Disorganized archives**
- **Lack of a backup system**
- **Non‑indexable documents**

With **Ippocra**, each medical report is automatically indexed thanks to optical character recognition (OCR) enhanced with technology based on genetic algorithms for text recognition. This means you can type keywords like *“cholesterol”* or *“ultrasound”* and retrieve the desired document within seconds.

## 4. Organize our medical reports once and for all with Ippocra

### Main benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Security** | End‑to‑end encryption ensures only you can access your data. |
| **Accessibility** | Available on desktop, iOS, and Android: your reports wherever you are. |
| **Smart search** | OCR and tagging let you find any information quickly. |
| **Automatic backup** | No risk of data loss, even if your device breaks. |

### Step‑by‑step guide to uploading reports
1. **Log in to Ippocra** (<https://ippocra.com/>) with your account.  
2. Click **“Upload new report”**.  
3. Select the file (PDF, image, etc.) or use your phone’s camera.  
4. Assign **relevant tags** (e.g., “Orthopedic visit – March 2024”).  
5. Save: the document will be indexed and appear in your digital library.

Once finished, you can **share** the reports with your doctor via a secure link, avoiding printed copies and further reducing administrative stress.
