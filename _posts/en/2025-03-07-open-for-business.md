# Ippocra is open for business!

After months of test, tries, adjustements and bureaucratic necessary steps, we are extremely
pleased to announce that Ippocra "<strong>is open for business</strong>"!

First of all, I would like to thank all our Beta users, who have provided lots of suggestions 
to improve the Platform so far, participating in our [open beta](/private-beta). Without
them we wouldn't be where we are now. That's why they will be *grandfather-in*, because
we like them a lot.

Today we are closing the beta and we are **opening to the world**.

Ippocra has four new subscription plans for the private user:

Our free plan, **Ippo**, gives the ability to have an account on Ippocra without any
payment, and has the ability to receive and store the documents via the IppoLink!

You may ask... What is an IppoLink?

## IppoLink: share your health data securely and quickly

A Ippolink is a link which provides you a secure and easy way to share your own health documents
with another person. If you are a clinic instead, you can use the Ippolink to share the reports
with your patient, always ina fast and secure way. And in a **easy* way.

It's easy to create a new IppoLink, and easy to use! More over, sending an IppoLink via Whatsapp,
email or any other means, you are not sharing the documents themselves directly on this platform,
but only the link to these. This is extremely important, because with this approach, the documents
do not get fagocitated and then used to train some random AI, exposing your data.

With our Ippo plan, you can import your health data if your clinic or doctor uses Ippocra. 

But there is more that you can do on Ippocra: when a document gets added to the Platform, 
it gets categorized into analysis, report or receipt, the exam's date gets extracted automatically, 
and, thanks to Ippocra technology, it is possible to use the Smart Search, which gives you the ability 
to find everything quickly.

## Why Ippocra exists?

Ippocra was born from the classic *Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch.* (cit. [The Cathedral and the Bazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)). 

To be precise, Michele (our founder and CEO.. -- *yes, Michele is writing this post using the third singular person. Please, give him some slack*) was the one having the problem to solve, because he coulnd't find a decent way to organize and 
find his own health record, and the one of his family.

When there is the need to go to a doctor, of any kind, maybe because he was in another country, maybe because it is 
impossible to find anything when you need it (yes, he had all the documents in a A4 binder, but it's totally useless, because it is never with you, and when you search you can't find anything anyway.), the health record were **never** available. 
They couldn't be shared easily with the new doctor, and they couldn't be organized. They were simply **useless**.

That's the reason [Ippocra](https://ippocra.com) was born, as a way to solve this problem and make the organization
of health record **easy and automatic**, where the used simply uploads a document, and Ippocra does all the rest.

## Taken from a true story

Some weeks ago, Michele went to a nefrologist for a check-up visit for his son. When the neforlogist asked if we had
some urine's exams done in the past, Michele logged into [Ippocra](https://app.ippocra.com/), he wrote **uri** on the search bar, and 
the blood work analysis shown up, which also had urine's exams inside! They were completely
useless to the doctor in this instance ;), but we had them handy! As you can see from the gif, now also the nefrologist report 
shows up, because it containes the work uri within. This is what we call **Smart Search**.

## Our paid plans

Our paid plans (Just Me, Family e Family⁺) are different from our Ippo plan, which is free. These are subscription plans 
that renew either monthly or yearly.

These are paid plans because provides the ability to upload own health documents to the Platform, and given that Ippocra
does not share data with no-one, the payment is necessary, given that **if you pay the product, you are not the product**.
Just Me is for one person, one admin, the Family and Family⁺ can have more persons and admins, according to the plan tier.

So why the Ippo is free? Ippo is free because you can only import the documents already present on Ippocra. This means 
that someone is already paiying to have the documents hosted. Especially, if they are coming from a [clinic that uses Ippocra](/business), they are the one footing the bill, providing the Ippocra experience to thier customers for free.

## Is it safe?

Let's remember that Michele is the first user of Ippoca, and he really cares about this stuff.
The data are encrypted with the AES 256, and this means that even in a hypothetical data breach, the
data that can be obtained are impossible to read without the decrypting key (which, go figure, we do not keep in
the same space ;)).

Ippocra has a very  [strong policy privacy](/legal/privacy-policy) and has Data Protection Officer 
already active, which you can find it in there.

## Super, I'm in. How can I subscribe?

Go to **[Ippocra](https://app.ippocra.com)** and register, after that pick the plan that suits you best and then
you are ready to use Ippocra. You can explore our plans and their prices **[here](/pricing)**.

Ciao for now, <br/>
Michele.
