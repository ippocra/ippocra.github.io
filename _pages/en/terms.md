This can occur provided that the private user has been previously and expressly authorized by the Beneficiary, or is legally authorized to act on behalf of the Beneficiary.

By providing the Beneficiary's personal data, the private User declares they are legally authorized or expressly authorized by the Beneficiary to manage, store, receive, or transmit their data, including health data, on their behalf.

If the private User, for any reason, loses the title under which they are responsible for the Beneficiary's data, they must immediately delete the Beneficiary’s account or remove their data from their account and plan. If the Beneficiary themselves decides to exercise their rights to deletion, rectification, withdrawal of consent, or wishes to transfer their data to a new personal account, the Company must be contacted.
