This privacy policy on the processing of personal data and cookies ("**Policy**") applies to the processing of personal data that occurs for users of the website ippocra.com ("**Site**"), the related service provided through the "web responsive" platform (currently not an app, but this may happen, and its use is accepted from now on), and any digital environment used by Ippocra S.R.L. to deliver its services ("**Services**").

The user is invited to carefully read this policy and the section "**Terms and Conditions**"([LINK](http://ippocra.com/legal/terms/)) before using any of our services and creating an account on our site ippocra.com ("**Account**").

**2. WHO IT APPLIES TO**

This policy applies to anyone who uses the site or the app or who uses one of the services provided by the Company. For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply:

* **“Visitor”** refers to anyone who accesses the site but does not register or possess an account and does not use the Services;

* **“Private User”** refers to any natural and/or legal person who registers or uses the Site or the App in order to manage and store their own and their plan members' medical records or other health documentation;

* **“Professional”** refers to any independent doctor or other healthcare professional working in the private sector who uses the services;

* **“Health Structure”** refers to any medical, laboratory, and/or any healthcare facility, whether private or public, that uses the services;

* **“User” or “Final User”** refers, depending on the case, to a Private User, a Professional, a Health Structure, or a Visitor.

* **“Beneficiary”** refers to a third person within the family unit, on behalf of whom the Final User may create an account (typically a minor under guardianship or parental authority, or an elderly person under the Final User’s care, a relative, etc.) or use our paid storage plans to also include the data of these persons along with their own.

The nature of the personal data collected and used, as well as the purposes of processing and the related legal bases, depend on the type of User, as defined above.

**3. PURPOSE OF THE NOTICE**

The main purpose of this notice is to provide complete information on how the Company collects, uses, stores, processes, and discloses personal data of Users when acting as the Data Controller **(“Data Controller”**). The Data Controller is the entity that determines the purposes, means, and methods of personal data processing, deciding how, for what purpose, and for how long to use your personal data.

The categories of Users "Professionals" and "Health Structures" themselves process personal data as Data Controllers, particularly the data of their patients and individuals who undergo any type of healthcare or diagnostic service with them. In these cases, the Company acts as the Data Processor.

In this case, it is the Professionals and Health Structures that determine the purposes and methods of processing, while the processor carries out processing activities on behalf of the Professional, following the relevant instructions and guidelines in the appointment document.

The information provided in this notice, where it indicates general information on how personal data is processed and our role as Data Processor for data processed by Professionals and Health Structures as Data Controllers, does not replace the notice that must be provided by the professional or health structure as the Data Controller.

This document is prepared by the Company to comply with the EU REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL of April 27, 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, as well as the free movement of such data. It also constitutes a valid tool for adopting the appropriate measures required by the regulation in accordance with the “accountability” principle (accountability) for data controllers and processors, meaning the adoption of proactive behaviors that demonstrate the concrete adoption of measures aimed at ensuring compliance with the regulation (see Articles 23-25, in particular, and the entire Chapter IV of the regulation). In essence, it represents the tool entrusted to controllers for defining the methods, guarantees, and limits of personal data processing in compliance with legal provisions and in light of some specific criteria indicated in the regulation.

**4. GENERAL INFORMATION FOR ALL USERS**

1) "Personal data": any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural or legal person ("**data subject**"); such as name, company name, identification number, location data, online identifier (email) and phone contact details, health and biometric data. ***NOTE***: In the case that data of family members or other individuals belonging to the final User's household (**“Beneficiaries”**) are uploaded, the same data referred to these individuals will be processed and treated as "Data Subjects" and will have the same rights attributed to them. Please refer to point 5.2 for further details on this matter.  
2) "Processing": any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;  
3) "Restriction of processing": marking stored personal data with the aim of limiting their future processing;  
4) "Profiling": any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects related to a natural person, particularly to analyze or predict aspects concerning the person’s professional performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements;  
5) "Pseudonymization": processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;  
6) "Archive": any structured set of personal data accessible according to determined criteria, whether centralized, decentralized, or functionally or geographically dispersed;  
7) "Data controller": the natural or legal person, public authority, service, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data; when the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the data controller or the specific criteria applicable to their designation may be established by Union or Member State law;  
8) "Data processor": the natural or legal person, public authority, service, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller;  
9) "Recipient": the natural or legal person, public authority, service, or another body to whom personal data are communicated, whether or not they are third parties.

f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”). The necessary information to define the processing activities is contained and detailed in the Register of Processing Activities.

- the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject’s request;  
- the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject;  
- the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person;  
- the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller;  
- the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or a third party, provided that these interests are not overridden by the data subject’s rights and freedoms, especially when the data subject is a minor.

**4.4. Source of data**

All data is collected when the Account is created and/or through forms filled out by Users in the context of using the Services and, in general, in connection with the use of the Services provided by the Company. Specifically, all health and biometric data contained in images and/or scans of reports, medical records, and exams that you decide to upload will be automatically collected and stored. The Site and App also collect data automatically when Visitors browse or use the Services, through tracking technologies such as cookies (see point 8).

If data of family members or other individuals belonging to the final User’s household (**“Beneficiaries”**) is uploaded, the same data will be processed as described above. The processing of health and biometric data is based on your consent. In the case that data of family members or other individuals from the final User's household are uploaded, the consent is deemed extended to include the processing of data relating to these individuals, whom the final User confirms to have informed about this privacy notice and who the final User confirms, under their responsibility, has provided all necessary consent for the processing of their respective data.

Please refer to point 5.2 for further details on this matter.

**4.6. Data protection measures**

The Company considers the protection of your personal data to be a top priority, especially given that it relates to health and other biometric data, and adopts adequate technical and organizational security measures in line with the highest standards required by the GDPR to protect them from any type of leakage, destruction, unauthorized access, etc.

These protection measures may include, by way of example, choosing server allocation and maximum-level security measures; additionally, data is encrypted during transit using the https protocol, and it is also encrypted on disk; backups are automatically performed on a scheduled basis. In the event of a Data Breach, the data would remain unreadable as it is encrypted. The platform is regularly tested for its security levels.

In any case, the User must use secure internet connections and keep their devices' security measures up to date to prevent the theft or damage/destruction of data during transmission.

**4.7. Sharing data with third parties**

Your personal data may be shared between the Site users, particularly between Private Users, Professionals, and Healthcare Facilities regarding patient health data and their treatment plans, or with third parties to whom the user decides to send their data by creating a secret link generated for the individual transfer (“**Secret Link**”).

Professionals and healthcare facilities, regarding the data they collect and later store on the Site and share with patients, act as Data Controllers.

Data may also be shared with service providers with Data Processors and Sub-processors (such as accountants/work consultants, hosting/service providers), as well as with the designated DPO, but only to the extent necessary to perform their respective roles and purposes.

Data may be shared, upon request, to comply with legal obligations, with law enforcement, the judiciary, and other public authorities.

**4.8. International data transfer**

Some of the third parties mentioned above may be located outside the European Union. In such cases, we ensure that the legal requirements established by applicable data protection laws are met for the safe transfer of such data, ensuring that the highest security standards are adopted for any international data transfer.

**4.9. Rights you can exercise over your personal data**

*The data subject has the right* to obtain from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed and, if so, to obtain access to personal data and the following information (“**Right to be informed**”):  
a) the purposes of the processing;  
b) the categories of personal data concerned;  
c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;  
d) where possible, the retention period for the personal data or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;  
e) the existence of the right of the data subject to request the rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning them or to object to the processing;  
f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;  
g) where the data were not collected from the data subject, all available information as to their source;  
h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and at least in such cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and consequences of such processing for the data subject. Where personal data is transferred to a third country or an international organization, the data subject has the right to be informed of the existence of appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. The data controller provides a copy of the personal data being processed. If further copies are requested by the data subject, a reasonable fee based on administrative costs may be charged. If the data subject submits the request electronically, the information will be provided in a commonly used electronic format, unless otherwise requested.

**4.10. Legal basis for processing**

You are not required to provide your personal data to the company. However, if you want to create an account and use the services, you need to provide us with some personal data. If you do not provide us with the necessary data to provide the requested services, and/or if you object to such processing, we may not be able to provide the requested Services.

The Company bases the conditions of consent on the following points:  
a. If the processing is based on consent, the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data.  
The registration of an account will always be considered as valid and free consent for the processing of personal data and the use of cookies.  
***NOTE:*** In the case where the end user uploads data of family members or other individuals belonging to the end user's household, the same data mentioned above will be processed for those individuals. The processing of health and biometric data is based on your consent. If data from family members or other individuals in the end user's household are uploaded, the consent is also considered extended and granted for the processing of the data of these individuals, whom the end user declares to have informed about the contents of this privacy notice and to have received all necessary consent for the processing of their data under their responsibility.

Continuing to browse the site will always be considered free consent to the use of cookies.  
b. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration that also covers other matters, the request for consent must be presented in a way that is clearly distinguishable from the other issues, in a comprehensible and easily accessible form, using simple and clear language. No part of such a declaration that constitutes a violation of this regulation is binding.  
c. The data subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. The data subject is informed of this before giving consent. Consent can be withdrawn as easily as it was given.  
d. When evaluating whether consent has been freely given, consideration must be given to, among other things, the possibility that the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, may be conditional on consent to the processing of personal data not necessary for the execution of that contract. Specific details on consent for various processing activities are provided in the Record of Processing Activities.  
For more information on the purposes of processing and the related legal bases, see points 5) and 6).

**4.11. Automated processes and profiling**

We do not process personal data that involve decisions based solely on the automated processing of your data, nor do we use fully automated decision-making processes based on your personal data that produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect your rights.

**4.12. Contacts**

To send us questions or requests, you can use the email address: [info@ippocra.com](mailto:info@ippocra.com), or use the contact form available on the Site, or write to us at: IPPOCRA S.R.L. Via Podgora 47, CAP 60124, Ancona.

**4.13. DPO and related contacts**

The DPO (Data Protection Officer) is the professional responsible for assisting the data controller in fulfilling the obligations arising from the GDPR. The DPO provides advice and support to the data controller in matters of personal data protection and serves as a point of contact for supervisory authorities and data subjects. The DPO must:

**4.14. Links to other websites**

The site and app may contain links to other websites, applications, or platforms, including through “social” buttons. While we strive to ensure that such links are to tools that share our high standards in terms of privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy policies of other websites, for which you should verify and adhere to the third-party service provider’s terms of service, including their privacy policy, and continue browsing only if you freely choose to do so and if this aligns with your security expectations for the processing of your data.

**5.2. Creating an account also for or on behalf of third parties**

The private User can create an account in the name and on behalf of a third party (usually a minor under guardianship or parental authority, an elderly person under the care of the final User, a relative, etc.) or use our paid storage plans where they can also enter the data of the same people (“**Beneficiaries**”) in addition to their own.

This can happen provided that the private User has been previously and expressly authorized by the Beneficiary, or is legally authorized to act on behalf of the Beneficiary.

In these cases, the private User may create an account or store data in the plan linked to their account only if they have a valid basis for transmitting the Beneficiary's personal data to the Company, professionals, and healthcare facilities, and they undertake to provide accurate, correct, complete, and truthful information about the Beneficiary.

In case the healthcare data is provided and/or uploaded by uploading healthcare documentation of family members or other subjects of the final User, the same data mentioned above relating to these subjects will also be processed. The processing of health and biometric data is based on your consent. If the data of family members or other individuals belonging to the final User's household are uploaded, the consent is deemed extended to the processing of such data, relating to persons that the final User declares to have informed about the content of this privacy notice and for whom the final User confirms they have received all necessary consent for processing the relevant data.

If the data of family members or other individuals belonging to the private User's household are uploaded, the same data mentioned above will be processed regarding those individuals, who will be equally considered "Data Subjects," and will have the same rights attributed to them.

By providing the Beneficiary's personal data, the private User declares to be legally authorized or expressly authorized by the Beneficiary to manage, store, receive, or transmit on their behalf the data, including healthcare data, that concern them.

If the private User, for any reason, loses the basis upon which they are responsible for the Beneficiary's data, they must immediately delete the Beneficiary's account or remove the Beneficiary's data from their account and plan. If the Beneficiary themselves decides to assert their rights to deletion, correction, withdrawal of consent, or if they wish to transfer their data to a new personal account, the company should be contacted.

The private User may include personal data of their family members in their profile, including health data (for example, if such data are relevant to your medical history) and share such data with professionals and healthcare structures, only where you have previously informed them of your intention, the purpose of the processing, and our data protection policies, and if you have obtained their consent.

**5.4. Role of the Company as Data Processor for Professionals or Healthcare Structures**

When the Professional or Healthcare Structure acts as an independent data controller of the personal data of the final User or Beneficiary – also using the data for their own purposes – and the same data is exchanged/stored using the services of our website, Ippocra SRL will act as the Data Processor for the personal data of the private User or the Beneficiary, in line with the privacy policy of the Professional or Healthcare Structure.

**6. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PROFESSIONALS**
